Ticket Tracker Overview

1. AS AN employee...I WANT to keep a count of all the tickets I have completed SO THAT I can manage my workflow
2. AS AN employee...I WANT to be able to track the number of tickets my coworkers have completed SO THAT I can compare the number of tickets we complete

Your task is to create a ticket tracking system. Each employee is on the data file and should be able to increment/decrement their ticket count.

Requirements:
1. Should be built in React
2. Each component should manage its own state
3. The components should be generated using a map()

Plan:
1. Create the components you think you will need (at least an employee component, possibly more)
2. Map over the data file below to create the components
3. Pass data into them via props
4. Use State to handle the increment and decrement of tickets
5. Style it however you like, but donâ€™t leave it blank
