AS AN employee

AS AN employee
I WANT to be able to track the number of tickets my coworkers have completed SO THAT I can compare the number of tickets we complete

Your task is to create a ticket tracking system. Each employee is on the data file and should be able to increment/decrement their ticket count.

 
Requirements:
1. Should be built in React
2. Each component should manage its own state
3. The components should be generated using a map()

Plan:
− Create the components you think you will need (at least an employee component, possibly more)
− Map over the data file below to create the components
− Pass data into them via props
− Use State to handle the increment and decrement of tickets
− Style it however you like, but don’t leave it blank
